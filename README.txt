"Yumly" by Abishan Shanmuhesan, Vincent Ton, Solofo Andrianina Rakotobe, Vivek Singathi

Yumly is a cuisine app, where users can explore recipes on filtered choices.
Users have to register an account before logging in to the application. Once logged in, users can filter and search for 
recipes from the Spoonacular API. Those recipes can be saved to create their own personal cookbook (WIP).
In addition, users can create their own recipes with their own ingredients, and save their recipes to their cookbook (WIP).
This project was developed using the Flask web framework to control and render templates designed with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
